            If you are already using push notifications in your app, then you will want to set up push notifications to get forwarded from Referral SaaSquatch to you.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://app.referralsaasquatch.com">Login to Referral SaaSquatch</a>, go to “setup” and under “Push Notification Forwarding URL” press the button labeled Reset.</li>
                <li>Paste the URL you would like Referral SaaSquatch to forward push notifications to into the URL field.</li>
                <li>Press the button labeled reset to complete.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            When we forward push notifications to you, we act as a transparent proxy so any errors from your app will bubble up to Recurly and trigger Recurly’s webhook retry policies.

            <h5><span class="label">Optional</span> Alternative integration - Forward to Referral SaaSquatch</h5>
                 
            <p>
            If you are currently use push notifications, then you can forward push notification to us instead of us forwarding to you. When you receive Recurly Push Notifications you will need to build a solution that forwards all incoming Push Notifications to our endpoint.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Push notifications that you forward do not need to be guaranteed. The next time we get a push notification from you, we’ll fully sync the info from the related accounts.</li>
                <li>Push notifications that you forward can be duplicated. If you send us the same notification twice, our system will just look at the current state of things and act accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            Please feel free to contact support@@saasquat.ch to talk to a developer about how to build this yourself.
